- Settings > Branches

  E.g., https://github.com/doblabs/easy-as-pypi/settings/branches

  - Click *Add branch protection rule*

    - Branch name pattern: `release`

    - Protect matching branches:

      - âœ“ Require a pull request before merging
        - âœ“ Require approvals
          - Required number of approvals before merging: 1
        - âœ“ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed

          - CHORE: Use search box to tediously add all checks!
            - ENTER: Type ``b`` into the box,
              and all **18** ``branch-checks-runner/`` jobs should appear
              - Click first one in list and repeat process for all of them
            - SAVVY: I think checks have to pass for the search box to work...
