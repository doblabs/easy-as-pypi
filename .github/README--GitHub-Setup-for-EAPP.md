## Protected branch

- Settings > Branches

  E.g., https://github.com/doblabs/easy-as-pypi/settings/branches

  - Click *Add branch protection rule*

    - Branch name pattern: `release`

    - Protect matching branches:

      - âœ“ Require a pull request before merging
        - âœ“ Require approvals
          - Required number of approvals before merging: 1
        - âœ“ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
        - âœ— Require review from Code Owners
        - âœ— Restrict who can dismiss pull request reviews

      - âœ“ Require status checks to pass before merging
        - âœ“ Require branches to be up to date before merging
          - CHORE: Use search box to tediously add all checks!
            - ENTER: Type `b` into the box,
              and all **18** `branch-checks-runner/` jobs should appear
              - Click first one in list and repeat process for all of them
            - SAVVY: I think checks have to pass for the search box to work...

    - Branch Context: `release`

  - Tokens

    - Copy `CODECOV_TOKEN` and add as repository secret (see above)

- Settings > Badges & Graphs

  E.g., https://app.codecov.io/gh/doblabs/easy-as-pypi/settings/badge

  - Copy the badge URL to `README.rst`, which includes a token

## Organization settings

### Organization secrets and variables

- Create a Personal access token *classic* so pushing version tag from
  `workflows/update-merged.yml` triggers release workflow, and so
  pushing code from `workflows/update-deps.yml` triggers checks.

  https://github.com/settings/tokens

  <!-- Note that I tried a *new* fine-grained personal access token
       (in *beta*) but did not get it to work. -->

  - Click *Generate new token* and pick *Generate new token (classic)*

    - Note: `EAPP-workflows`

    - Expiration: Up to a year, or none, you choose

    - Select scopes: Enable one setting: `public_repo` (under `repo`).

  - Add org secret for personal access token (PAT)

    E.g., https://github.com/organizations/doblabs/settings/secrets/actions

    - Click *New organization secret*

      - Name: `USER_PAT`

      - Value: *Copied from previous step*

 <!-- - Value: `ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` -->

- Add org var for Git commit user (for `bin/update-poetry`, called by
  `workflows/update-deps.yml`)

  E.g., https://github.com/organizations/doblabs/settings/variables/actions

  - Click *New organization variable*

    - Name: `UPDEPS_USER_EMAIL`

      Value: `<user>@users.noreply.github.com`
