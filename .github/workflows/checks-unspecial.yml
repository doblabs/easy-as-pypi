# SAVVY: This is the name used for the workflow status badge, e.g.,
#   https://github.com/doblabs/easy-as-pypi/actions/workflows/checks-unspecial.yml/badge.svg?branch=release
# - 2023-10-08: All the README badges currently use lowercased, single word
#   names, e.g., from left-to-right,
#     checks|passing codecov|90% docs|passing release|v1.1.3 pypi|v1.1.3
#       python|3.9|3.10|3.11 license|MIT
#   So we'll do the same here (unlike other workflows whose names are capitalized)
#   - I.e., rather than
#     name: Checks — Unspecial Push
# USYNC: This name is used in the README badge.
