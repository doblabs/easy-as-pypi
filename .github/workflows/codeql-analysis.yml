# SAVVY: Note this is generally the workflow that takes the longest
# (it takes ~3m for the easy-as-pypi reference project).
# - You might want to disable the pull_request check if you don't find
#   much value in this scan and it's blocking your PR flow. (And then
#   it'll just run on schedule, so you'll still benefit, eventually.)
