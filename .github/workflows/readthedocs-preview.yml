# Also note that the link appears before docs are finished building,

  # DUNNO: The RTD workflow example:
  #   https://github.com/readthedocs/actions/tree/v1/preview
  # shows just a 'pull_request_target' hook and not 'pull_request'.
  # - But I don't see 'pull_request_target' run.
  # FIXME: Try PR some separate user, see if this runs then.
  #
  # Note that 'pull_request_target' allows write access (so PR
  # can be commented) and allows access to secrets. So don't
  # do anything with these powers below that could be dangerous
  # (like checkout the users PR code and try running it, because
  # they could've edited Makefile or pyproject.toml or the code
  # to do malicious things).
  pull_request_target:
    types:
      - opened
    # Execute this action only on PRs that touch
    # documentation files.
    paths:
      - "**/*.rst"
      - "docs/**"

  # As mentioned above, 'pull_request' runs on local PRs, and
  # not 'pull_request_target' (though per docs, a local PR
  # run via 'pull_request' has implicit write and secrets
  # access like 'pull_request_target').
