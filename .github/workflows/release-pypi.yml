# This workflow reacts to the 'release' event, which sets:
#   GITHUB_SHA — Last commit in the tagged release
#   GITHUB_REF — Tag ref of release refs/tags/<tag_name>
#
# We also support the manually-triggered workflow_dispatch event, in which
# case the workflow reads the version tag from the HEAD of the default branch.
#

#   https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#using-event-activity-types
#   https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
#
# - Per the docs, we want the 'published' event, and not, say 'created' or 'released':
#   - "If you want a workflow to run when stable and pre-releases publish,
#      subscribe to published instead of released and prereleased."
#     CXREF: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#release
#   - Two other events, 'created' and 'released', are related (though with
#     somewhat confusing names, e.g., I get that a 'release' might be 'created'
#     or 'published', but what does it mean when a 'release' is 'released'?).
#     - 'created':   "A draft was saved, or a release or pre-release was published
#                     without previously being saved as a draft."
#     - 'published': "A release, pre-release, or draft of a release was published."
#     - 'released':  "A release was published, or a pre-release changed to a release."
#     CXREF: https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#release

# - Note, too, I've seen this written without the 'types' entry, e.g.,:
#     on:
#       release:
#         - published

  release:

        # - It's not prudent to publish normal packages to test.PyPI,
        #   because the normal package was made from a normal build,
        #   and the normal build only includes normal sources.
        #   - That is, the `poetry build` was run on the main branch,
        #     and its pyproject.toml uses deps from normal PyPI.
        #     - And if we post such a project to test.PyPI, whose deps
        #       might ref older versions than the current alpha deps,
        #       I'd assume there'd be chayos. Maybe package versions
        #       downgrading, or Poetry failing because deps conflicts,
        #       I guess I'm not sure, but it smells like danger.
        #   - And note that pip uses the first package index it finds
        #     that has the source. I.e., pip *does not* search multiple
        #     indices and pick the largest-version source.
        # - So for either type or release cascade, whether 'alpha'
        #   or 'patch', we always publish to the same package index.

  # This is a kludge — and while not as rare as a 29 in cribbage, it's
  # not everyday you get to craft a kludge.
  #
  # - The smoke-test code was originally here, or at least it was
  #   meant to be here.
  #
  #   But no matter how long the sleep (and you need to sleep > ~12 sec.
  #   after publishing to PyPI before you can pip-install a new version),
  #   be it 15, 30, 60, or 300 secs., `pip(x) install` would always fail,
  #   complaining "Could not find a version that satisfies...."
  #
  #   - Here's the kludge: Run the workflow again, but in a fresh context.
  #
  #     - Note that merely making a 'uses' job doesn't work, as reusable
  #       workflows run within the same context as the caller.
  #
  #     - Note, too, there might be a way to get around this within the
  #       same workflow. (I tried `pip cache remove ${PACKAGE_NAME}`,
  #       which removes nothing, because no wheels files downloaded,
  #       not surprising, but worth a shot.)
  #
  #     - REFER: This feels similar to `poetry cache clear PyPI --all`,
  #       when `poetry update` doesn't see a new release, but Poetry
  #       is not involved here.

  # - DUNNO/2023-10-08: I ran this workflow manually, and pipx-install
  #   installed the version. But then in the new workflow, pipx-install
  #   failed (on the exact same command). I re-ran the workflow, and then
  #   it worked.
  #   - Is this a race condition? Do we need to sleep longer?
  #     Is GHA recycling (Python) environments and doing this?
