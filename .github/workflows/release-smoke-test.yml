      # - On GH and PyPI it's still the original tag, because the
      #   workflow uses the Git tag.

      #       pipx install easy-as-pypi==1.1.0a3

      #       easy-as-pypi version 1.1.0-a.3
      # - FTREQ/2023-06-04: Validate version in `release-github.yml`:
      #   - Run `poetry dynamic-versioning`.
      #   - Parse Toml to confirm version.
      #   - Cleanup with `git reset --hard HEAD`.
      #   - UCASE: Prevent getting here and failing because PyPI version
      #            and application version are different.
