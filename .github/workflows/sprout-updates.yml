# USAGE: Use this workflow to start a release cascade,
#        beginning on the current project.
#
#        The user can choose both cascade options:
#
#        - Whether to call poetry-update, and whether to update
#          all deps, or just "our" deps.
#
#        - Whether to bump the version, and by how much.
#
# - SAVVY: If both inputs are 'skip', workflows will run from
#   one project to another, but nothing really happens.
#
# - SAVVY: If user choose 'alpha' or 'least' cascade-deps option, workflow
#   will publish to test.PyPI (and smoke-test will pip-install from there).
#   - For 'alpha', this is obvious: The EAPP workflow advertises that
#     if only publishes pre-release versions to test.PyPI.
#   - For 'least', this is less obvious: If one package is already
#     pre-release, 'least' will publish another pre-release version.
#     Thus, we can only assure that downstream packages always get the
#     latest upstream versions, whether pre-release or normal, if all
#     projects along the cascade stick to using test.PyPI.
#
# - SAVVY: If user just wants to update third-party deps, they can set
#   cascade-version to 'skip' (and cascade-updatedeps to not 'skip').
#   Then, because none of "our" deps will be versioned and released,
#   poetry-update will likely not see any new versions of "our" deps,
#   but poetry-update may find third-party deps with newer versions.

# SAVVY: GitHub imposes a nested reusable workflow limit of 3, so we cannot
# call update-deps as a reusable workflow. I.e., this won't work:
#
#   jobs:
#     update-deps:
#       uses: ./.github/workflows/update-deps.yml
#       secrets: inherit
#       with:
#         cascade-updatedeps: ${{ ... }}
#         cascade-versioning: ${{ ... }}
#
# Because we'll end up at the disallowed fourth level if both values
# are 'skip' and each workflow keeps calling the next one, e.g.,:
# - First (1), this workflow (sprout-updates) runs. Then it calls
#   (2) update-deps, which, because 'skip', calls
#   (3) update-merged, which because 'skip', calls
#   (4) spread-updates, which is fine, this is depth 3,
#   *however*, spread-updates uses (5) ci-tags-wrangle, and
#   then we've exceeded the limit, which GH Actions actually
#   sees before running any jobs, during parsing, and fails:
#     job "wrangle-ci-tags-cleanup" calls workflow
#     "./.github/workflows/ci-tags-wrangle.yml", but doing
#     so would exceed the limit on called workflow depth of 3
#
# So here rather than nesting update-deps, we'll dispatch it
# using `gh`.
