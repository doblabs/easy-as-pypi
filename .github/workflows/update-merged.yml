#   # - USYNC: PYTHON_VERSION usage in .github/workflows/*.
#   PYTHON_VERSION: 3.11

# The workflow runs on *all* closed PRs, so we need to filter.
#
# - We'll skip the job itself if the PR is obviously inactionable:
#
#   - Check that the PR was merged. If not, there's nothing to do.
#
#   - Look for the poetry.lock tag, added by .github/bin/update-poetry.
#
# - We'll run the job but fail if the tagged and merged PR looks fishy:
#
#   - Verify the tag name matches the .github/bin/update-poetry format.
#     E.g.,
#
#       $ jq .event.pull_request.head.ref pull_request.json
#       "update-deps/202311041112/9f9255a89e96"
#
#       $ jq .head_ref pull_request.json
#       "update-deps/202311041112/9f9255a89e96"
#
# - There are a few more items we could verify, but currently don't:
#
#   - Verify it's the same user that update-poetry uses to make the PR.
#     E.g.,
#
#       $ jq .event.pull_request.user.login pull_request.json
#       "user"
#
#       # DUNNO: Are these the workflow actors? Do they always match
#       #   the PR user? Does the workflow runs as user who committed
#       #   HEAD? I should read up, and test with separate GH user.
#       $ jq .actor pull_request.json
#       "user"
#       $ jq .triggering_actor pull_request.json
#       "user"
#
#   - Verify the auto-merge properties:
#
#       $ jq .event.pull_request.auto_merge.enabled_by.login pull_request.json
#       "user"
#
#       $ jq .event.pull_request.auto_merge.merge_method pull_request.json
#       "rebase"
#
#   - Verify PR title and body
#
#       $ jq .event.pull_request.title pull_request.json
#       "Build: Bump poetry.lock (bump all)"
#
#       $ jq .event.pull_request.body pull_request.json
#       "Cascading release"
