# `make docs` generates at least two files for the API reference, an
# index file (modules.rst), and an API reference (project-name.rst).
#   docs/modules.rst
#   docs/pypi_and_die.rst
# We could exclude these from the repo, because generated, but don't, so
# that they'll appear in `git ls-files` diffs between projects that share
# the PyPI-and-Die boilerplate, which is helpful when syncing changes.
#
# You might also want to tweak the generated docs/pypi_and_die.rst file,
# to, say, tweak the TOC. For an example, see:
#   docs/pypi-and-die.rst
