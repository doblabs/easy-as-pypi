# `make docs` generates two files for the API reference -- one is just
# an index file (modules.rst), and the other is the auto-generated API
# reference. Generally, the generated files are sufficient:
# 2020-01-25: For release-ghub-pypi, I will commit this two files,
#  for diff'ability with other projects.
#docs/modules.rst
#docs/release_ghub_pypi.rst
# But if you want, you could override the latter, say, to tweak the TOC.
# See the alternatively formatted modules TOC:
