# HOWTO: Add project URLs to this table. If you use special keywords in
# the name or certain domains in the URL, PyPI will treat them specially
# or at least iconify them.
# - These names are special:
#     "download"
#     "home", "homepage", "home page"
#     "changelog", "change log", "changes", "release notes",
#         "news", "what's new", "history"

#     "bug*", "issue*", "tracker*", "report*"
#     "funding*", "donate*", "donation*", "sponsor*"
