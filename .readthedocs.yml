# Required
version: 2

# Set the version of Python and other tools you might need
build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "3.11"
    # You can also specify other tool versions:
    #
    #  nodejs: "19"
    #  rust: "1.64"
    #  golang: "1.19"

# Build documentation in the docs/ directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/conf.py

# If using Sphinx, optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF
#
#  formats:
#     - pdf

# Optionally declare the Python requirements required to build your docs
#
#  python:
#     install:
#     - requirements: docs/requirements.txt
#
# (lb): Poetry wiring.
# - RTD doesn't support Poetry, but `pip install .` supports
#   pyproject.toml per PEP 517.
# - We also add 'readthedocs' extras, which installs 'tomli'
#   so that docs/conf.py can read pyproject.toml metadata
#   (DRY: So we can avoid hardcoded strings from therein).
# - CXREF:
#   https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#poetry-and-pep-517
python:
  install:
    - method: pip
