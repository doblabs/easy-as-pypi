# USAGE: Set BROWSER environ to pick your browser, otherwise webbrowser
# ignores the system default and goes through its list, which starts
# with 'mozilla'.
#
# E.g.,
#
#   BROWSER=chromium-browser make view-coverage
#
# Alternatively, you could leverage sensible-utils (Linux), e.g.,
#
#   BROWSER=sensible-browser make view-coverage
#
# (and probably `open` on macOS, I'd guess).

# Here we define a macro used to set a local variable we can run later.
define BROWSER_PYSCRIPT
import os, webbrowser, sys
try:
	from urllib import pathname2url
except:
	from urllib.request import pathname2url

webbrowser.open("file://" + pathname2url(os.path.abspath(sys.argv[1])))
endef
export BROWSER_PYSCRIPT

PYBROWSER := python -c "$$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"

# Note that setting the Makefile "BROWSER" variable  â€” or any variable with
# the same name as an existing environ from the shell (e.g., try "HOME") â€”
# changes the same-named environ name, e.g.,
#
#   - Herein:
#
#       BROWSER := python -c "$$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"
#
#       print-browser-vars:
#         @echo "\$$(BROWSER): $(BROWSER)"
#         @echo "\$${BROWSER}: $${BROWSER}"
#       .PHONY: print-browser-vars
#
#   - Shell:
#
#       $ make print-browser-vars
#       $(BROWSER): python -c import os, webbrowser, sys try: from urllib ...
#       ${BROWSER}: python -c "$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"
#
#   I.e., $(BROWSER) was set to the macro we defined (as the result of
#   the := assignment), and ${BROWSER} was set to the assignment statement
#   itself.
#
# But if we set a variable with a unique name that doesn't match an
# existing environ, that the shell variable of the same name is left
# unset, e.g.,
#
#   - Herein:
#
#     PYBROWSER := python -c "$$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"
#
#     print-pybrowser-vars:
#       @echo "\$$(PYBROWSER): $(PYBROWSER)"
#       @echo "\$${PYBROWSER}: $${PYBROWSER}"
#     .PHONY: print-browser-vars

# USAGE: Run `make install` to create a "global" virtualenv.
#
# - A "global" virtualenv installs to WORKON_HOME (~/.virtualenvs by
#   default) as inspired by virtualenvwrapper.
#
#   - But note we call `python -m venv` directly and don't bother
#     with virtualenvwrapper's `mkvirtualenv` command.
#
# CXREF: https://github.com/landonb/virtualenvwrapper (our fork)
#   https://github.com/python-virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper (original)

# USEIT: The author only uses a subset of virtualenvwrapper commands:
#
# - The `workon` command lets you start a virtualenv easily from any
#   directory, e.g.,
#
#     $ workon <project-name>
#
#   It also supports tab completion.
#
# - The `cdproject` command changes to the project directory.
#
# - The `cdsitepackages` command changes to the current environment's
#   site-packages/ directory.
#
#   This is especially useful if you're digging into a package issue,
#   or if you want to edit a dependency's sources (the author sometimes
#   sets a breakpoint in a package dependency to help diagnose an issue
#   or to learn more about the code).

# SAVVY: Note that you *could* install to system Python using
# Poetry directly (there's no make task to do so), e.g.,
#
#   $ deactivate
#   $ poetry install
#
# But you likely want to isolate the environment, because there's no
# way we can guarantee that our dependencies match whatever else you
# might have installed to the system Python. Hence the somewhat
# opinionated virtualenv installation choices â€” you should use a
# virtualenv, and we're just providing the framework we like to use.

# SAVVY: There's no target for deleting and recreating the virtualenv.
# - You could call virtualenvwrapper's `rmvirtualenv <project-name>`,
#   or just remove it directly.
# MAYBE/2023-05-16: Make a cleanup-venv task?

# IGNOR: If you run make-install again, pip-install-poetry downgrades libs:
#
#   ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account
#     all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of
#     the following dependency conflicts.
#   click-hotoffthehamster 0.0.1 requires platformdirs<4.0.0,>=3.5.0, but you have platformdirs 2.6.2 which is incompatible.
#   click-hotoffthehamster 0.0.1 requires virtualenv<21.0.0,>=20.23.0, but you have virtualenv 20.21.1 which is incompatible.
#   tox 4.5.1 requires platformdirs>=3.2, but you have platformdirs 2.6.2 which is incompatible.
#
# But then the subsequent poetry-install restores them:
#
#   Package operations: 0 installs, 4 updates, 0 removals
#
#     â€¢ Updating packaging (21.3 -> 23.1)
#     â€¢ Updating filelock (3.8.0 -> 3.12.0)
#     â€¢ Updating platformdirs (2.5.2 -> 3.5.1)
#     â€¢ Updating virtualenv (20.16.5 -> 20.23.0)
#
# - So just don't worry about it (if you see that ERROR and corresponding red text).

# USAGE: Run `EDITABLES_ROOT=<path> make editable` to create dev-friendly
# `.editable/pyproject.toml` that'll install the project in editable mode.
#
# - E.g., after you've cloned EDITABLE_PJS projects to ~/.kit/py, run:
#
#     EDITABLES_ROOT=~/.kit/py make editable
#
# to create `.editable/pyproject.toml` with the correct local paths.
#
# - You wouldn't normally run this task: `make develop` runs it.
#
#   - But it would be useful to run on its own if you're diagnosing
#     a poetry-install failure.

# USEIT: If you are using our virtualenvwrapper fork, you can activate
# the editable virtualenv easily:
#
#   $ cd <path-to-project>
#   $ workon
#
# - If not, just do it the old-fashioned way:
#
#   $ . <venv-name>/bin/activate

# - Note we use quoted [ -d ] test [ -d "$${pyprojs_full}/$${project}" ]
#   to support space characters in path name, but the shell won't expand
#   a *quoted* tilde '~', so we do that ourselves.
#   - But because not Bash, we cannot use variable pattern substitution:
#       "$${pyprojs_root/#\~/$$HOME}"
#     So we use `sed` instead, but we use '@' delimiters and not normal '/',
#     because path contains '/' (so then path now cannot contain @ symbol).

# - If a project is not found locally, an ALERT is printed, but you don't
#   need to care unless you want to hack on that project, too. E.g., if
#   you only care that the main project is editable, say, Birdseye, just
#   clone that repo locally and don't worry about the dependency repos.
#   - Otherwise, clone 'em all, though maybe consider `myrepos` or a similar
#     multiple repository tool to ease the burden of fetching and maintaining
#     them all.

# - The second sed simply strips the trailing '|' the for-loop might leave.

# - The third sed adds "../" prefixes to the new .editable/pyproject.toml,
#   so it references the README.rst and pacakge from its parent directory.
#
#   - Note the sed expects a specific pyproject format:
#
#     - The README is easy, just keep the line like this:
#
#         readme = "README.rst"
#
#       and it'll be transformed to:
#
#         readme = "../README.rst"
#
#     - The packages list is trickier.
#
#       - An old-school setup, foregoing a src/ directory, might look like this:
#
#           packages = [{include = "easy_as_pypi"}]
#
#         which will be transformed to:
#
#           packages = [{include = "../easy_as_pypi"}]
#
#       - A setup using the conventional src/ directory could look like this:
#
#           packages = [{include = "easy_as_pypi", from = "src"}]
#
#         which is transformed to:
#
#           packages = [{include = "easy_as_pypi", from = "../src"}]
#
#         But note that Poetry looks for a src/<package> dir by default, so
#         you may be able to omit the 'packages' setting in your project TOML.
#
#         - The ../SOURCE_DIR symlink (possibly src -> ../src) will steer
#           Poetry to the correct location.

# USYNC: The lint target dependency list should match tox.ini's envlist.

# we can check that flake8 doesn't counteract black. Also, tox uses

# *Make linty!* Call `make linty` to lint and see full lint report.
# - `make lint` will stop of first failed lint task, which is sometimes
#   what you want (to fix the failure), though other times you want the
#   full lint report (see all tasks that failed).
# - The `tox` 'lint' label lets you run all lint tasks, but tox doesn't
#   run `black`, it runs `isort` in no-touchy mode, and its `flake8`
#   won't prepare the quickfix file.
# - So here we present a `make lint` + `tox run -m lint`.

# Run flake8, and collect and send errors to Vim quickfix.

# CXREF: See [tool.flake8] `format` option in pyproject.toml.
# - This format should match the sed command pattern, below.
#
# Re: flake8 output:
# - It'd be nice to find something like `tag` for `flake8`
#     https://github.com/aykamko/tag
#   E.g., where `e1` from the shell opens the first lint error in your editor,
#   `e2` opens the second, etc. (While `black` is great, it doesn't fix
#    everything; it would be convenient to open lint errors from the term.)
# - Another option is using Vim quickfix, e.g., from the terminal:
#     flake8 | tee >(sed "s@^./@$(pwd)/@" > .flake8.out)
#   And then within Vim:
#     set errorformat=%f\ %l:%m
#     cgetfile /path/to/project/.flake8.out
#   Which is automated by the gvim_load_quickfix shell-out.

# ISOFF/2023-05-18: In a previous life (because in my current life I

# See comments in pyproject.toml: Latest doc8 and sphinx-rtd-theme conflict,
# because latter requires older docutils.
# - So here we install and run `doc8` in its own virtualenv, outside the
#   purview of Poetry.
# - Essentially, we have to pick one or the other (or neither) package to
#   install in the `make develop` virtualenv; we can't have them both.
#   - Furthermore, because Poetry checks dependencies across groups, we
#     need to omit one or the other (or both) from the pyproject.toml
#     Poetry config, lest Poetry still complain about the conflict
#     (i.e., we cannot use different --with options to poetry-install).
# - For simplicity, we choose to omit doc8 from pyproject.toml.
#   - It's just the one package, whereas sphinx is more than one package.
#     So if we leave the sphinx packages in pyproject.toml, then Poetry
#     will check for dependency conflicts between the sphinx packages.
#   - Also because we `pip install doc8` in the dedicated virtualenv, we
#     know there won't be any conflicts, as it's the only package installed.
# - Alternatively, we could manage another pyproject.toml for doc8,
#   but that's way more overhead and doesn't afford us any gains.

# SAVVY: By default, a pipeline returns the exit code of the final command,
# so if you pipe to `tee`, the pipeline always returns true, e.g.,
#
#   pytest ... | tee ...
#
# will always return true, regardless of py.text failing or not.
#
# - One work-around is the pipefail option,
#   e.g., put this at the top of the Makefile:
#
#     SHELL = /bin/bash -o pipefail
#     ...
#     _test_local:
#       set -o pipefail
#       pytest ... | tee ...
#
#   But then pipefail (and bash) apply to all targets that shell-out.
#
# - A better approach is to use the PIPESTATUS environ.
#
# - Another approach that I didn't care to test â€” I like the PIPESTATUS
#   approach â€” but that might work would be to combine the operation in-
#   to one command, e.g.,
#
#     SHELL = /bin/bash
#     ...
#     _test_local:
#       set -o pipefail; \

# As mentioned alongside doc8 target, doc8 conflicts with sphinx-rtd-theme.
# - 2023-05-18: doc8 v1.1.1 depends on recent docutils (>=0.19,<0.21) but
#               sphinx-rtd-theme v1.2.0 requires older docutils (<0.19).
# - So those two packages cannot coexist in the same virtualenv, e.g.,
#   we cannot install them both in the `make develop` virtualenv.
#   - Furthermore, then cannot both be listed in pyproject.toml, because
#     Poetry checks dependencies across groups, regardless of what's being
#     installed.
#   - So we decided to boot doc8 from pyproject.toml, because it has no
#     other dependencies, whereas sphinx-rtd-theme works with Sphinx.
#     - Meaning, Poetry will check that sphinx-rtd-theme and sphinx don't
#       conflict. But there will be no conflicts with doc8 given that it'll
#       be the only package installed in its virtualenv.
# - All that said, we could build docs in the `make develop` virtualenv,
#   but we'll use a dediciated virtualenv like we do for doc8. (It's not
#   bad practice to isolate some tools, either, and this code was a gimme
#   considering we isolated the doc8 task, so we'll just use the same code.)
