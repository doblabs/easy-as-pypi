# USAGE: Set BROWSER environ to pick your browser, otherwise webbrowser
# ignores the system default and goes through its list, which starts
# with 'mozilla'.
#
# E.g.,
#
#   BROWSER=chromium-browser make view-coverage
#
# Alternatively, you could leverage sensible-utils (Linux), e.g.,
#
#   BROWSER=sensible-browser make view-coverage
#
# (and probably `open` on macOS, I'd guess).

# Here we define a macro used to set a local variable we can run later.
define BROWSER_PYSCRIPT

	from urllib import pathname2url

webbrowser.open("file://" + pathname2url(os.path.abspath(sys.argv[1])))
endef
export BROWSER_PYSCRIPT

PYBROWSER := python -c "$$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"

# Note that setting the Makefile "BROWSER" variable  â€” or any variable with
# the same name as an existing environ from the shell (e.g., try "HOME") â€”
# changes the same-named environ name, e.g.,
#
#   - Herein:
#
#       BROWSER := python -c "$$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"
#
#       print-browser-vars:
#         @echo "\$$(BROWSER): $(BROWSER)"
#         @echo "\$${BROWSER}: $${BROWSER}"
#       .PHONY: print-browser-vars
#
#   - Shell:
#
#       $ make print-browser-vars
#       $(BROWSER): python -c import os, webbrowser, sys try: from urllib ...
#       ${BROWSER}: python -c "$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"
#
#   I.e., $(BROWSER) was set to the macro we defined (as the result of
#   the := assignment), and ${BROWSER} was set to the assignment statement
#   itself.
#
# But if we set a variable with a unique name that doesn't match an
# existing environ, that the shell variable of the same name is left
# unset, e.g.,
#
#   - Herein:
#
#     PYBROWSER := python -c "$$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"
#
#     print-pybrowser-vars:
#       @echo "\$$(PYBROWSER): $(PYBROWSER)"
#       @echo "\$${PYBROWSER}: $${PYBROWSER}"
#     .PHONY: print-browser-vars
#

#     $ make print-pybrowser-vars
#     $(PYBROWSER): python -c import os, webbrowser, sys try: from urllib ...
#     ${PYBROWSER}:

# This I cannot explain (though I'd assume it's documented or at least

# USAGE: Run `make install` to create a "global" virtualenv.
#
# - A "global" virtualenv installs to WORKON_HOME (~/.virtualenvs by
#   default) as inspired by virtualenvwrapper.
#
#   - But note we call `python -m venv` directly and don't bother
#     with virtualenvwrapper's `mkvirtualenv` command.
#
# CXREF: https://github.com/landonb/virtualenvwrapper (our fork)
#   https://github.com/python-virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper (original)

# USEIT: The author only uses a subset of virtualenvwrapper commands:
#
# - The `workon` command lets you start a virtualenv easily from any
#   directory, e.g.,
#
#     $ workon <project-name>
#
#   It also supports tab completion.
#
# - The `cdproject` command changes to the project directory.
#
# - The `cdsitepackages` command changes to the current environment's
#   site-packages/ directory.
#
#   This is especially useful if you're digging into a package issue,
#   or if you want to edit a dependency's sources (the author sometimes
#   sets a breakpoint in a package dependency to help diagnose an issue
#   or to learn more about the code).

# SAVVY: Note that you *could* install to system Python using
# Poetry directly (there's no make task to do so), e.g.,
#
#   $ deactivate
#   $ poetry install
#
# But you likely want to isolate the environment, because there's no
# way we can guarantee that our dependencies match whatever else you
# might have installed to the system Python. Hence the somewhat
# opinionated virtualenv installation choices â€” you should use a
# virtualenv, and we're just providing the framework we like to use.

# SAVVY: There's no target for deleting and recreating the virtualenv.
# - You could call virtualenvwrapper's `rmvirtualenv <project-name>`,
#   or just remove it directly.
# MAYBE/2023-05-16: Make a cleanup-venv task?

# IGNOR: If you run make-install again, pip-install-poetry downgrades libs:
#
#   ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account
#     all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of
#     the following dependency conflicts.
#   click-hotoffthehamster 0.0.1 requires platformdirs<4.0.0,>=3.5.0, but you have platformdirs 2.6.2 which is incompatible.
#   click-hotoffthehamster 0.0.1 requires virtualenv<21.0.0,>=20.23.0, but you have virtualenv 20.21.1 which is incompatible.
#   tox 4.5.1 requires platformdirs>=3.2, but you have platformdirs 2.6.2 which is incompatible.
#
# But then the subsequent poetry-install restores them:
#
#   Package operations: 0 installs, 4 updates, 0 removals
#
#     â€¢ Updating packaging (21.3 -> 23.1)
#     â€¢ Updating filelock (3.8.0 -> 3.12.0)
#     â€¢ Updating platformdirs (2.5.2 -> 3.5.1)
#     â€¢ Updating virtualenv (20.16.5 -> 20.23.0)
#
# - So just don't worry about it (if you see that ERROR and corresponding red text).

# INERT/2023-05-16: This used to `clean`, but I don't see any reason.

# USAGE: Run `EDITABLES_ROOT=<path> make editable` to create dev-friendly
# `.editable/pyproject.toml` that'll install the project in editable mode.
#
# - E.g., after you've cloned EDITABLE_PJS projects to ~/.kit/py, run:
#
#     EDITABLES_ROOT=~/.kit/py make editable
#
# to create `.editable/pyproject.toml` with the correct local paths.
#
# - You wouldn't normally run this task: `make develop` runs it.
#
#   - But it would be useful to run on its own if you're diagnosing
#     a poetry-install failure.

# USEIT: If you are using our virtualenvwrapper fork, you can activate
# the editable virtualenv easily:
#
#   $ cd <path-to-project>
#   $ workon
#
# - If not, just do it the old-fashioned way:
#
#   $ . <venv-name>/bin/activate

# - Note we use quoted [ -d ] test [ -d "$${pyprojs_full}/$${project}" ]
#   to support space characters in path name, but the shell won't expand
#   a *quoted* tilde '~', so we do that ourselves.
#   - But because not Bash, we cannot use variable pattern substitution:
#       "$${pyprojs_root/#\~/$$HOME}"
#     So we use `sed` instead, but we use '@' delimiters and not normal '/',
#     because path contains '/' (so then path now cannot contain @ symbol).

# - If a project is not found locally, an ALERT is printed, but you don't
#   need to care unless you want to hack on that project, too. E.g., if
#   you only care that the main project is editable, say, Birdseye, just
#   clone that repo locally and don't worry about the dependency repos.
#   - Otherwise, clone 'em all, though maybe consider `myrepos` or a similar
#     multiple repository tool to ease the burden of fetching and maintaining
#     them all.

# - The second sed simply strips the trailing '|' the for-loop might leave.

# - The third sed adds "../" prefixes to the new .editable/pyproject.toml,
#   so it references the README.rst and pacakge from its parent directory.
#
#   - Note the sed expects a specific pyproject format:
#
#     - The README is easy, just keep the line like this:
#
#         readme = "README.rst"
#
#       and it'll be transformed to:
#
#         readme = "../README.rst"
#
#     - The packages list is trickier.
#
#       - An old-school setup, foregoing a src/ directory, might look like this:
#
#           packages = [{include = "easy_as_pypi"}]
#
#         which will be transformed to:
#
#           packages = [{include = "../easy_as_pypi"}]
#
#       - A setup using the conventional src/ directory could look like this:
#
#           packages = [{include = "easy_as_pypi", from = "src"}]
#
#         which is transformed to:
#
#           packages = [{include = "easy_as_pypi", from = "../src"}]
#
#         But note that Poetry looks for a src/<package> dir by default, so
#         you may be able to omit the 'packages' setting in your project TOML.
#
#         - The ../SOURCE_DIR symlink (possibly src -> ../src) will steer
#           Poetry to the correct location.

# SAVVY: By default, a pipeline returns the exit code of the final command,
# so if you pipe to `tee`, the pipeline always returns true, e.g.,
#
#   pytest ... | tee ...
#
# will always return true, regardless of py.text failing or not.
#
# - One work-around is the pipefail option,
#   e.g., put this at the top of the Makefile:
#
#     SHELL = /bin/bash -o pipefail
#     ...
#     test-local:
#       set -o pipefail
#       pytest ... | tee ...
#
#   But then pipefail (and bash) apply to all targets that shell-out.
#
# - A better approach is to use the PIPESTATUS environ.
#
# - Another approach that I didn't care to test â€” I like the PIPESTATUS
#   approach â€” but that might work would be to combine the operation in-
#   to one command, e.g.,
#
#     SHELL = /bin/bash
#     ...
#     test-local:
#       set -o pipefail; \
#       pytest ... | tee ...
#
#   But, as mentioned above, then we're applying Bash to all shell-outs,
#   and this author would prefer POSIX-compatible shell code when possible.

# Docstrings ref:
#   https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
# (lb): We auto-generate docs/modules.rst and docs/<package_name>.rst
# so that :ref:`genindex` and :ref:`modindex`, etc., work, but we might
# instead maintain a separate docs/<project-name>.rst, so that we can
# include special method docs, such as those for and __new__ methods.
# - I tried to disable the generation of modules.rst and $(SOURCE_DIR).rst
#   using options in conf.py, but failed. And I thought maybe one could
#   comment-off 'sphinx.ext.autodoc' to stop them, but no. It's all in the
#   command.
#   - Use -T to disable modules.rst creation, e.g.,
#       sphinx-apidoc -T -o docs/ $(SOURCE_DIR)
#   - Use appended exclude patterns to include command docs, e.g.,
#       sphinx-apidoc -T -o docs/ $(SOURCE_DIR) $(SOURCE_DIR)/commands/
#     will stop docs/$(SOURCE_DIR).commands.rst.
#   - To not generate docs/$(SOURCE_DIR).rst, just don't call sphinx-apidoc!
#     That is, neither of these calls that use exclude patterns will work:
#       sphinx-apidoc -T -o docs/ $(SOURCE_DIR) $(SOURCE_DIR)/
#       sphinx-apidoc -T -o docs/ $(SOURCE_DIR) $(SOURCE_DIR)/__init__.py
