# USAGE: Set BROWSER environ to pick your browser, otherwise webbrowser
# ignores the system default and goes through its list, which starts
# with 'mozilla'.
#
# E.g.,
#
#   BROWSER=chromium-browser make view-coverage
#
# Alternatively, you could leverage sensible-utils (Linux), e.g.,
#
#   BROWSER=sensible-browser make view-coverage
#
# (and probably `open` on macOS, I'd guess).

# Here we define a macro used to set a local variable we can run later.
define BROWSER_PYSCRIPT
import os, webbrowser, sys
try:
	from urllib import pathname2url
except:
	from urllib.request import pathname2url

webbrowser.open("file://" + pathname2url(os.path.abspath(sys.argv[1])))
endef
export BROWSER_PYSCRIPT

PYBROWSER := python -c "$$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"

# Note that setting the Makefile "BROWSER" variable  â€” or any variable with
# the same name as an existing environ from the shell (e.g., try "HOME") â€”
# changes the same-named environ name, e.g.,
#
#   - Herein:
#
#       BROWSER := python -c "$$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"
#
#       print-browser-vars:
#         @echo "\$$(BROWSER): $(BROWSER)"
#         @echo "\$${BROWSER}: $${BROWSER}"
#       .PHONY: print-browser-vars
#
#   - Shell:
#
#       $ make print-browser-vars
#       $(BROWSER): python -c import os, webbrowser, sys try: from urllib ...
#       ${BROWSER}: python -c "$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"
#
#   I.e., $(BROWSER) was set to the macro we defined (as the result of
#   the := assignment), and ${BROWSER} was set to the assignment statement
#   itself.
#
# But if we set a variable with a unique name that doesn't match an
# existing environ, that the shell variable of the same name is left
# unset, e.g.,
#
#   - Herein:
#
#     PYBROWSER := python -c "$$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"
#
#     print-pybrowser-vars:
#       @echo "\$$(PYBROWSER): $(PYBROWSER)"
#       @echo "\$${PYBROWSER}: $${PYBROWSER}"
#     .PHONY: print-browser-vars
#
#   - Shell:
#
#     $ make print-pybrowser-vars
#     $(PYBROWSER): python -c import os, webbrowser, sys try: from urllib ...
#     ${PYBROWSER}:
#
#
# This I cannot explain (though I'd assume it's documented or at least
# there's a reasonable explanation).

# USAGE: If you want to define your own tasks, add your own Makefile.

-include Makefile.local

# SAVVY: By default, a pipeline returns the exit code of the final command,
# so if you pipe to `tee`, the pipeline always returns true, e.g.,
#
#   py.test ... | tee ...
#
# will always return true, regardless of py.text failing or not.
#
# - One work-around is the pipefail option,
#   e.g., put this at the top of the Makefile:
#
#     SHELL = /bin/bash -o pipefail
#     ...
#     test-local:
#       set -o pipefail
#       py.test ... | tee ...
#
#   But then pipefail (and bash) apply to all targets that shell-out.
#
# - A better approach is to use the PIPESTATUS environ.
#
# - Another approach that I didn't care to test â€” I like the PIPESTATUS
#   approach â€” but that might work would be to combine the operation in-
#   to one command, e.g.,
#
#     SHELL = /bin/bash
#     ...
#     test-local:
#       set -o pipefail; \
#       py.test ... | tee ...
#
#   But, as mentioned above, then we're applying Bash to all shell-outs,
#   and this author would prefer POSIX-compatible shell code when possible.

# Docstrings ref:
#   https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
# (lb): We auto-generate docs/modules.rst and docs/<package_name>.rst
# so that :ref:`genindex` and :ref:`modindex`, etc., work, but we might
# instead maintain a separate docs/<project-name>.rst, so that we can
# include special method docs, such as those for and __new__ methods.
# - I tried to disable the generation of modules.rst and easy_as_pypi.rst
#   using options in conf.py, but failed. And I thought maybe one could
#   comment-off 'sphinx.ext.autodoc' to stop them, but no. It's all in the
#   command.
#   - Use -T to disable modules.rst creation, e.g.,
#           sphinx-apidoc -T -o docs/ easy_as_pypi
#   - Use appended exclude patterns to include command docs, e.g.,
#           sphinx-apidoc -T -o docs/ easy_as_pypi easy_as_pypi/commands/
#     will stop docs/easy_as_pypi.commands.rst.
#   - To not generate docs/easy_as_pypi.rst, just don't call sphinx-apidoc!
#     That is, neither of these calls that use exclude patterns will work:
#           sphinx-apidoc -T -o docs/ easy_as_pypi easy_as_pypi/
