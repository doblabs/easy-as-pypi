#   this path is specific to my development machines), but there's
#   not a reasonable default we can assume. TL/DR, I'll allow this.

# USAGE: Set BROWSER environ to pick your browser, otherwise webbrowser
# ignores the system default and goes through its list, which starts
# with 'mozilla'.
#
# E.g.,
#
#   BROWSER=chromium-browser make view-coverage
#
# Alternatively, you could leverage sensible-utils (Linux), e.g.,
#
#   BROWSER=sensible-browser make view-coverage
#
# (and probably `open` on macOS, I'd guess).

# Here we define a macro used to set a local variable we can run later.
define BROWSER_PYSCRIPT

export BROWSER_PYSCRIPT

PYBROWSER := python -c "$$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"

# Note that setting the Makefile "BROWSER" variable  â€” or any variable with
# the same name as an existing environ from the shell (e.g., try "HOME") â€”
# changes the same-named environ name, e.g.,
#
#   - Herein:
#
#       BROWSER := python -c "$$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"
#
#       print-browser-vars:
#         @echo "\$$(BROWSER): $(BROWSER)"
#         @echo "\$${BROWSER}: $${BROWSER}"
#       .PHONY: print-browser-vars
#
#   - Shell:
#
#       $ make print-browser-vars
#       $(BROWSER): python -c import os, webbrowser, sys try: from urllib ...
#       ${BROWSER}: python -c "$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"
#
#   I.e., $(BROWSER) was set to the macro we defined (as the result of
#   the := assignment), and ${BROWSER} was set to the assignment statement
#   itself.
#
# But if we set a variable with a unique name that doesn't match an
# existing environ, that the shell variable of the same name is left
# unset, e.g.,
#
#   - Herein:
#
#     PYBROWSER := python -c "$$BROWSER_PYSCRIPT"
#
#     print-pybrowser-vars:
#       @echo "\$$(PYBROWSER): $(PYBROWSER)"
#       @echo "\$${PYBROWSER}: $${PYBROWSER}"
#     .PHONY: print-browser-vars
#
#   - Shell:

#     $ make print-pybrowser-vars
#     $(PYBROWSER): python -c import os, webbrowser, sys try: from urllib ...
#     ${PYBROWSER}:

#
# This I cannot explain (though I'd assume it's documented or at least

# USAGE: If you want to define your own tasks, add your own Makefile.
#
# You could e.g., define a help task extension thusly:
#
#   $ echo -e "_help_local::\n\t@echo 'More help!'" > Makefile.local

MAKEFILE_LOCAL ?= Makefile.local

# `make lint` opt-outs

#
#     EAPP_MAKEFILE_PYDOCSTYLE_DISABLE=false make pydocstyle

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# USAGE: Run `make install` to create a "global" virtualenv.
#
# - A "global" virtualenv installs to WORKON_HOME (~/.virtualenvs by
#   default) as inspired by virtualenvwrapper.
#
#   - But note we call `python -m venv` directly and don't bother
#     with virtualenvwrapper's `mkvirtualenv` command.
#
# CXREF: https://github.com/landonb/virtualenvwrapper (our fork)
#   https://github.com/python-virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper (original)

# USEIT: The author only uses a subset of virtualenvwrapper commands:
#
# - The `workon` command lets you start a virtualenv easily from any
#   directory, e.g.,
#
#     $ workon <project-name>
#
#   It also supports tab completion.
#
# - The `cdproject` command changes to the project directory.
#
# - The `cdsitepackages` command changes to the current environment's
#   site-packages/ directory.
#
#   This is especially useful if you're digging into a package issue,
#   or if you want to edit a dependency's sources (the author sometimes
#   sets a breakpoint in a package dependency to help diagnose an issue
#   or to learn more about the code).

# SAVVY: Note that you *could* install to system Python using
# Poetry directly (there's no make task to do so), e.g.,
#
#   $ deactivate
#   $ poetry install
#
# But you likely want to isolate the environment, because there's no
# way we can guarantee that our dependencies match whatever else you
# might have installed to the system Python. Hence the somewhat
# opinionated virtualenv installation choices â€” you should use a
# virtualenv, and we're just providing the framework we like to use.

# SAVVY: There's no target for deleting and recreating the virtualenv.
# - You could call virtualenvwrapper's `rmvirtualenv <project-name>`,
#   or just remove it directly.
# MAYBE/2023-05-16: Make a cleanup-venv task?

# IGNOR: If you run make-install again, pip-install-poetry downgrades libs:
#
#   ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account
#     all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of
#     the following dependency conflicts.
#   click-hotoffthehamster 0.0.1 requires platformdirs<4.0.0,>=3.5.0, but you have platformdirs 2.6.2 which is incompatible.
#   click-hotoffthehamster 0.0.1 requires virtualenv<21.0.0,>=20.23.0, but you have virtualenv 20.21.1 which is incompatible.
#   tox 4.5.1 requires platformdirs>=3.2, but you have platformdirs 2.6.2 which is incompatible.
#
# But then the subsequent poetry-install restores them:
#
#   Package operations: 0 installs, 4 updates, 0 removals
#
#     â€¢ Updating packaging (21.3 -> 23.1)
#     â€¢ Updating filelock (3.8.0 -> 3.12.0)
#     â€¢ Updating platformdirs (2.5.2 -> 3.5.1)
#     â€¢ Updating virtualenv (20.16.5 -> 20.23.0)

# MAYBE/2023-05-21: Perhaps switch to *Using One Shell*:
#
#   https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/One-Shell.html
#
# - A `.ONESHELL:` on any line enables this feature.
#   It applies globally. You can not restrict to single recipe.
# - If I had known about this sooner, or thought to read the docs to
#   see if something like this was available, I probably would've
#   explored using it.
#   - Though with the new Makeout.sh companion library, my latest
#     advice is that if you need line continuations in Makefile,
#     the recipe is probably too complex, and should be moved to
#     the shell-out. The added benefit is function reusability
#     (with parameter pasasing) and proper syntax highlighting.

# USAGE: Run `EDITABLES_ROOT=<path> make editable` to create dev-friendly
# `.pyproject-editable/pyproject.toml` that installs project in editable mode.
#
# - E.g., after you've cloned EDITABLE_PJS projects to ~/.kit/py, run:
#
#     EDITABLES_ROOT=~/.kit/py make editable
#
# to create `.pyproject-editable/pyproject.toml` with the correct local paths.
#
# - You wouldn't normally run this task: `make develop` runs it.
#
#   - But it would be useful to run on its own if you're diagnosing
#     a poetry-install failure.

# USEIT: If you are using our virtualenvwrapper fork, you can activate
# the editable virtualenv easily:
#
#   $ cd <path-to-project>
#   $ workon
#
# - If not, just do it the old-fashioned way:
#
#   $ . <venv-name>/bin/activate

# - Note we use quoted [ -d ] test [ -d "$${pyprojs_full}/$${project}" ]
#   to support space characters in path name, but the shell won't expand
#   a *quoted* tilde '~', so we do that ourselves.
#   - But because not Bash, we cannot use variable pattern substitution:
#       "$${pyprojs_root/#\~/$$HOME}"
#     So we use `sed` instead, but we use '@' delimiters and not normal '/',
#     because path contains '/' (so then path now cannot contain @ symbol).

# - If a project is not found locally, an ALERT is printed, but you don't
#   need to care unless you want to hack on that project, too. E.g., if
#   you only care that the main project is editable, say, Birdseye, just
#   clone that repo locally and don't worry about the dependency repos.
#   - Otherwise, clone 'em all, though maybe consider `myrepos` or a similar
#     multiple repository tool to ease the burden of fetching and maintaining
#     them all.

# - The second sed simply strips the trailing '|' the for-loop might leave.

# - The third sed adds "../" prefixes to new .pyproject-editable/pyproject.toml,
#   so it references the README.rst and pacakge from its parent directory.
#
#   - Note the sed expects a specific pyproject format:
#
#     - The README is easy, just keep the line like this:
#
#         readme = "README.rst"
#
#       and it'll be transformed to:
#
#         readme = "../README.rst"
#
#     - The packages list is trickier.
#
#       - An old-school setup, foregoing a src/ directory, might look like this:
#
#           packages = [{include = "easy_as_pypi"}]
#
#         which will be transformed to:
#
#           packages = [{include = "../easy_as_pypi"}]
#
#       - A setup using the conventional src/ directory could look like this:
#
#           packages = [{include = "easy_as_pypi", from = "src"}]
#
#         which is transformed to:
#
#           packages = [{include = "easy_as_pypi", from = "../src"}]
#
#         But note that Poetry looks for a src/<package> dir by default, so
#         you may be able to omit the 'packages' setting in your project TOML.
#
#         - The ../SOURCE_DIR symlink (possibly src -> ../src) will steer
#           Poetry to the correct location.

# The awk match is checking for a dependency line like one of these:
#
#     easy-as-pypi = "^1.2.3"
#     easy-as-pypi = "==1.2.3"
#     easy-as-pypi = "> 1.2.3"
#     easy-as-pypi = "<= 1.2.3"
#                     ||||
#                     |||â””â†’ [0-9]+
#                     ||â””â”€â†’ \s*

#                     â””â”´â”€â”€â†’ [<>=^]{1,2}

# Run flake8, and collect and send errors to Vim quickfix.

# CXREF: See [tool.flake8] `format` option in pyproject.toml.
# - This format should match the sed command pattern, below.
#
# Re: flake8 output:
# - It'd be nice to find something like `tag` for `flake8`
#     https://github.com/aykamko/tag
#   E.g., where `e1` from the shell opens the first lint error in your editor,
#   `e2` opens the second, etc. (While `black` is great, it doesn't fix
#    everything; it would be convenient to open lint errors from the term.)
# - Another option is using Vim quickfix, e.g., from the terminal:
#     flake8 | tee >(sed "s@^./@$(pwd)/@" > .flake8.out)
#   And then within Vim:
#     set errorformat=%f\ %l:%m

# See comments in pyproject.toml: Latest doc8 and sphinx-rtd-theme conflict,
# because latter requires older docutils.
# - So here we install and run `doc8` in its own virtualenv, outside the
#   purview of Poetry.
# - Essentially, we have to pick one or the other (or neither) package to
#   install in the `make develop` virtualenv; we can't have them both.
#   - Furthermore, because Poetry checks dependencies across groups, we
#     need to omit one or the other (or both) from the pyproject.toml
#     Poetry config, lest Poetry still complain about the conflict
#     (i.e., we cannot use different --with options to poetry-install).
# - For simplicity, we choose to omit doc8 from pyproject.toml.
#   - It's just the one package, whereas sphinx is more than one package.
#     So if we leave the sphinx packages in pyproject.toml, then Poetry
#     will check for dependency conflicts between the sphinx packages.
#   - Also because we `pip install doc8` in the dedicated virtualenv, we
#     know there won't be any conflicts, as it's the only package installed.
# - Alternatively, we could manage another pyproject.toml for doc8,
#   but that's way more overhead and doesn't afford us any gains.

# As mentioned alongside doc8 target, doc8 conflicts with sphinx-rtd-theme.
# - 2023-05-18: doc8 v1.1.1 depends on recent docutils (>=0.19,<0.21) but
#               sphinx-rtd-theme v1.2.0 requires older docutils (<0.19).
# - So those two packages cannot coexist in the same virtualenv, e.g.,
#   we cannot install them both in the `make develop` virtualenv.
#   - Furthermore, then cannot both be listed in pyproject.toml, because
#     Poetry checks dependencies across groups, regardless of what's being
#     installed.
#   - So we decided to boot doc8 from pyproject.toml, because it has no
#     other dependencies, whereas sphinx-rtd-theme works with Sphinx.
#     - Meaning, Poetry will check that sphinx-rtd-theme and sphinx don't
#       conflict. But there will be no conflicts with doc8 given that it'll
#       be the only package installed in its virtualenv.
# - All that said, we could build docs in the `make develop` virtualenv,
#   but we'll use a dediciated virtualenv like we do for doc8. (It's not
#   bad practice to isolate some tools, either, and this code was a gimme
#   considering we isolated the doc8 task, so we'll just use the same code.)
