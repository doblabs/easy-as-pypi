# ALERT: Outdated scripts

These scripts work against circa 2019 boilerplate that used `setup.py`.

- These need to be updated for latest `pyproject.toml` framework.

- Or you could just figure it out manually, it's not too involved.

Applies to:

    clone-and-rebrand-easy-as-pypi.sh
    copy-header-from-setup.cfg-to-all-files.sh
    make-your-own-branded-pypi-project--example.sh
