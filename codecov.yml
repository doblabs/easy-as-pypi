#   # ISOFF/2023-05-22: No longer necessary. But documented for posterity.

#   # # (lb): With setting disable_default_path_fixes, I see:
#   # #   "There was an error processing coverage reports."
#   # # Strangely, I find exactly 7 hits when I Goggle this keyname.
#   # # And they all point to a codecov issue comment:
#   # #   https://github.com/codecov/support/issues/396#issuecomment-300879528
#   # # which is a dead link.
#   # # There are a few score more hits on GitHub proper:
#   # #   https://github.com/search?l=&q=disable_default_path_fixes&type=Code
#   # # but still solely yaml results. I.e., cannot find application source
#   # # that reads/uses this value.
#   # # - Is this an undocumented, proprietary https://codecov.io setting?
#   #
#   # disable_default_path_fixes: true

# ISOFF/2023-05-22: Possibly related to `disable_default_path_fixes` setting
# that used to be enabled? In any case, this `fixes` setting causes repeated
# Codecov.io paths â€” `path/to/project/src/easy_as_pypi/src/easy_as_pypi/...`.
#
# # Specify the GitHub project directory path prefix so that clicking source
# # files in codecov.io opens the coverage browser.
# #
# fixes:
#   - "::src/easy_as_pypi/"
