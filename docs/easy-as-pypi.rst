.. (lb): This is *not* a generated file like pypi_and_die.rst (or modules.rst, etc.).
..
..       Rather, this file was copyied from a generated docs/pypi_and_die.rst
..       and altered with additional options.
..
..       - Note that the Sphinx and autodoc extension docs suggest these options
..         should be settable via docs/conf.py, but I had no such success.
..
..       - See comment in Makefile docs-html re: controlling which auto-generated
..         files are created.
