#     https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/customize.html#setup-cfg

#  --strict-markers   markers not registered in the `markers` section
#                     of the configuration file raise errors.
#
#  --tb=style         traceback print mode (auto/long/short/line/native/no).
#

#                     (p/P), or (A)ll.  (w)arnings are enabled by default
#                     (see --disable-warnings),  'N' can be used to reset
#                     the list. (default: 'fE').
