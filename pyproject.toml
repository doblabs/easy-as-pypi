# - pytest settings can be set in any of these files:

#     pytest.ini / pyproject.toml / tox.ini / setup.cfg
#
#   though it's recommended to avoid the latter.
#
# - Ref:
#
#     https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/customize.html#setup-cfg
#
# - Hint:
#
#  --strict-markers   markers not registered in the `markers` section
#                     of the configuration file raise errors.
#
#  --tb=style         traceback print mode (auto/long/short/line/native/no).
#
#  -r chars           show extra test summary info as specified by chars:
#                     (f)ailed, (E)rror, (s)kipped, (x)failed, (X)passed,
#                     (p)assed, (P)assed with output, (a)ll except passed
#                     (p/P), or (A)ll.  (w)arnings are enabled by default
#                     (see --disable-warnings),  'N' can be used to reset
#                     the list. (default: 'fE').

# coverage options
# ================

# CXREF: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html

# Note that if .coveragerc exists, these settings are ignored.

[tool.coverage.report]

# Use 'precision' to adjust the HTML coverage value, e.g.,
#   precision = 3
# might show
#   94.737%
# Whereas (the default)
#   precision = 0
# would instead show
#   95%
precision = 0

# The 'exclude_lines' option might be useful if want to exclude
# the main entry point, which might not be easily testable.
#
# - E.g., if the main __init__.py contains the lines:
#
#       if __name__ == '__main__':
#           main()  # <-- This line is missed
#
#   You could exclude the block using the config:
#
#       exclude_lines = [ "if __name__ == .__main__.:", ]
#
# - For the easy-as-pypi reference project, we don't currently
#   test the Click group command:
#
#       @click.group()
#       def cli():
#           pass  # <-- This line is missed
#
#   Which we could skip (not count as missed) using the config:
#
#       exclude_lines = [ "def cli\\(\\):", ]
#
#   but really we should add coverage (because I don't think
#   it's that difficult, but at least missing it has provided
#   a good example of how 'exclude_lines' values are regex).

[tool.coverage.run]

# Tabulate branch coverage, too.
branch = true

# Specifying 'source' is unnecessary, e.g.,
#   source = [ "src/", "tests/", ]
# is the same as either:
#   coverage run -m pytest tests/
#   # Or:
#   coverage run -m pytest tests/ src/
# However if you wanted to omit tests/ coverage, you could do this:
#   source = [ "src/", ]
