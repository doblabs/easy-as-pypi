# 2020-12-13: (lb): TBH, not sure where I got these options from, or why,
#                   probably from hamster-cli and I just never removed them
#                   or understood if-why I needed them.
#  --strict-markers      markers not registered in the `markers` section of the
#                        configuration file raise errors.
#  --tb=style            traceback print mode (auto/long/short/line/native/no).
#  -r chars              show extra test summary info as specified by chars:
#                        (f)ailed, (E)rror, (s)kipped, (x)failed, (X)passed,
#                        (p)assed, (P)assed with output, (a)ll except passed
#                        (p/P), or (A)ll. (w)arnings are enabled by default (see
#                        --disable-warnings), 'N' can be used to reset the list.
#                        (default: 'fE').
